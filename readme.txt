For the skill assessment, we will be testing out your ability to pick up someone else's code and take it to the next level. 
For the hypothetical situation, a FED has been working on a project but got pulled off so we need your help.

Here's what the FED has to say:

This is where we got to in the cut, but we are having problems and haven't been able to fully test. 
Can you help us resolve the following issues as well as help catch if we missed something?
The client is very particular about having fast page speed, good SEO, and wants interesting interactive pieces.
Support wise they also want to have this page look right in browsers that are over 5% of the browser stats for the US over the past couple of months
Below are the items we haven't been able to get to yet.

Font:
  - We set up the Allura and Alex Brush font family stacks in the CSS but we don't have the fonts included  ОК
We added paths in the html file to include Allura and Alex Brush font family.
Site Logos:
  - We need to account for retina screens ОК
We optimizied the logos for retina screens with svg files.
Icons:
  - We haven't been able to add the icons to the setup yet      ОК
  - Hamburger menu, cart, and search icons haven't been added   ОК
We added svg files for the hamburger menu and the shopping cart. The search icon was taken from the PSD file and placed as a PNG in the html file.
Navigation:
  - We haven't setup functionality for the menu toggle to open up the bottom footer area in small screens   ОК
We set up the functionality for the menu toggle according PSD and JPG files in "PSDs" directory and in the code there are comments for them.
Slideshow:
  - We need another slide created from the PSD  
  - The styling isn't right yet for slide content as well        ОК
  - We also haven't been able to set up the slide functionality  ОК
We styled the slideshow. The code is in the main.js file with comment " // Slider " for this functionality.
Footer:
  - We got a fair amount of responsive styles done for the site however the footer isn't quite there yet  ОК
  - Social media icons need to be setup so some html changes there to put them in is fine. ОК
We set up the social media icons in the html file and styled them like it is in the PSD file
  - Expander accordion Javascript functionality hasn't been setup or styled  ОК
We styled it and the functionality code is in the main.js with comment " // Footer Accordion ". The styles are in the main.css with comment " /* Footer Responsive Design - accordeon */ "
  - Footer bottom area: we unfortunately can't pull the html content out of its location
We styled the footer-bottom area with css. There is a comment in the file " /* Footer-bottom Responsive Design */ "
  - Can we style up the setup so it matches the desktop and mobile styles  ОК
Yes. The desktop and the mobile styles are as shown in the PSD files. 
Responsive:
  - For some reason the site isn't switching over to "mobile" styles in devices  ОК
  - Also when you shrink down the browser some sort of content is causing a   in smaller screens  ОК
  - In between sizes for tablet portrait feel fairly empty, is there something we can style to make them look better  ОК
The client is very active in the project and wants a technical breakdown of what you did and how you resolved the missing items. 
So we need a writing assessment as well as the code above. 
They also want to know how the design UI/UX and FED code practices could be improved down the road, so please include that as well in your writing.
